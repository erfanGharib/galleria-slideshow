On the contrary, we rightly blame and believe worthy of contempt and hatred those who, allowing themselves to be corrupted by the attractions of a present voluptuousness, do not foresee how many evils and sorrows a blind passion can expose them to. I say the same about those who, out of softness of mind, that is, by fear of pain and sorrow, fail in the duties of life. And it is very easy to give reason for what I am saying. For when we are completely free, and nothing prevents us from doing what can give us the most pleasure, we can indulge entirely in voluptuousness and drive away all kinds of pain; but, in the times destined for the duties of society or the necessity of business, it is often necessary to divorce oneself with voluptuousness, and not to refuse to sorrow. The rule that a wise man follows in this is to renounce slight voluptuousness to have greater ones, and to know how to endure slight pains to avoid more unfortunate ones.
