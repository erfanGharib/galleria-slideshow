No one fears or flees voluptuousness as voluptuousness, but as it attracts great pain to those who do not know how to make moderate and reasonable use of it; and no one loves or seeks pain as pain, but because sometimes it happens that, through work and sorrow, one manages to enjoy a great voluptuousness. Indeed, to go down to the little things, who of you does not do some painful exercise to get some kind of usefulness from them? And who could just blame, avoid a pain from which he could not expect any pleasure."

I say the same about those who, out of softness of mind, that is, by fear of pain and sorrow, fail in the duties of life. And it is very easy to give reason for what I am saying. For when we are completely free, and nothing prevents us from doing what can give us the most pleasure, we can indulge entirely in voluptuousness and drive away all kinds of pain; but, in the times destined for the duties of society or the necessity of business, it is often necessary to divorce oneself with voluptuousness, and not to refuse to sorrow. The rule that a wise man follows in this is to renounce slight voluptuousness to have greater ones, and to know how to endure slight pains to avoid more unfortunate ones."
