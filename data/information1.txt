To make you better aware of where the error of those who blame voluptuousness, 
and who somehow praise pain, comes from, I will enter into a more extensive explanation,
and make you see all that has been said about it by the inventor of the truth, and, 
so to speak, by the architect of the happy life. No one fears or flees voluptuousness as
voluptuousness, but as it attracts great pain to those who do not know how to make moderate 
and reasonable use of it; and no one loves or seeks pain as pain, but because sometimes it happens that,
through work and sorrow, one manages to enjoy a great voluptuousness. Indeed, to go down to the little things, 
who of you does not do some painful exercise to get some kind of usefulness from them? And who could just blame, 
or the one who would seek a voluptuousness that could not be followed by anything unfortunate, or the one who would 
avoid a pain from which he could not expect any pleasure.
